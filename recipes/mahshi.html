            <li>500g mince meat</li>
            <li>350g Egyptian rice</li>
            <li>1 large white onion, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120g) room temperature ghee </li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp boharat (seven spice)</li>
            <li>400ml vegetable stock</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and rinse the rice in a fine mesh strainer until water runs clear. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl add the rice, mince meat, minced onion, ghee, salt, pepper and boharat and mix with your hands until well incorporated. Set the stuffing aside.</li>
            <li>In a deep casserole pot (18cm/7in), place the sliced onion rings so they cover the base. </li>
            <li>Now set up your vine leaves stuffing assembly line! Take a vine leaf, rough side up, and spread it on to a plate and remove the tiny stalk. Add a teaspoon of the stuffing and place in the middle of the leaf towards the bottom, shaping it into a cylinder. Fold the sides of the leaf inwards over the stuffing and roll, going as tightly as you can. 
            </li>
            <li>Repeat until you run out of the stuffing mix, then pack the rolled vine leaves into the casserole pot, again as tightly as you can, as shown above. </li>
            <li>In a small sauce pan, bring the vegetable stock to a boil adding salt if necessary. Remove from heat and add the lemon juice. </li>
            <li>Pour stock over the vine leaves until submerged. Take a smaller plate and flip upside down, use to cover vine leaves to keep everything compact by pressing down.</li>
            <li>Add the lid and place the pot on a high heat. Once it starts to boil, bring to a simmer and cook for 1 hour. The leaves should be tender, soft to the bite and rice cooked through. </li>
            <li>Place a large serving plate over the pot and flip in one quick motion (perhaps over the sink if itâ€™s your first go!) and serve. Bel hana! </li>
        </ol>
